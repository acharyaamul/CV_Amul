	abstract = {Utilization of land reclamation area offers the potentiality of increasing greenery as well as providing forest products. This study refers to the identification of the land reclamation areas and potential plantation areas on the Bagmati river-basin in the Terai region of Nepal, and recommends appropriate species for plantation in order to rehabilitate such areas. Multi-temporal Landsat Satellite Images (Landsat 7 and Landsat 8) were acquired for 2002 and 2014. Object-based Image Classification method was used to classify the land cover classes into four broad categories: i) Water, ii) Sand and gravel, iii) Plantation potential (open areas suitable for plantation) and iii) Others (forest, agriculture, built-up areas etc.). The Mean Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) values and Mean Brightness values were found to be helpful in identifying the water and sand \& gravel areas from the other land cover classes. The overall classification accuracy was 0.97 with a kappa coefficient of 0.89 in the case of the 2014 Image classification. In this study, the land reclamation area referred to the areas occupied by water, sand \& gravel on the river-beds that were converted into plantation potential and other classes between 2002 and 2014. Similarly, the potential plantation area referred to the summation of the area of reclaimed land, the area of ‘Others’ class converted into ‘Plantation potential’ class and the area that remained to be plantation potential on the bed of the Bagmati River and its tributaries between 2002 and 2014. Altogether, 4,819.10 ha land was reclaimed in the study area, and a total of 5,395.10 ha land was found to be potential for plantation within the study area.Banko JanakariA Journal of Forestry Information for NepalVol. 26, No. 1, Page:53-59, 2016},

	abstract = {Bamboo, also known as "poor man's timber," is one of Nepal’s most significant forest species and is widely distributed through the country. Bamboo resources have tremendous social, cultural, and ecological implica­ tions, suggesting a need for further investigation and exploration. The majority of past studies have focused on the socio-economic and ethno-botanical aspects of bamboo in parts of Nepal but the ecological information and research statistics for bamboo, as well as its contribution to Nepalese communities, are still unexplored. This study reviewed the existing literature, and was supported by our research experience on the bamboo resource in Nepal. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) method for systematically reviewing the literature related to bamboo. The review process mainly focused on three aspects that included (1) research trends on bamboo forests, (2) a review of the status and distribution of bamboo species in Nepal, (3) an assessment of bamboo forest ecosystem services. We found that a total of 12 genera and more than 53 bamboo species have been recorded in Nepal, with highest species diversity in the Hill region. Bamboo in Nepal provides different ecosystem services ranging from social (spiritual significance for local communities), economic (lumber, medicine, water, biofuel, and crafts), to ecological (carbon stock/sequestration, landscape restoration). It forms the basis for local livelihoods as well as enhancing the climate resilience of local com­ munities in Nepal. However, the majority of studies on bamboo have concentrated on its economic potential with a low focus on provisioning, habitat and cultural services. This represents a major gap. The lack of data on various aspects of the conservation status of bamboos and the ecosystem services that they provide indicates the need for more detailed and comprehensive research on these aspects.},

	abstract = {In the recent years, object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach has emerged with an attempt to overcome limitations inherited in conventional pixel-based approaches. OBIA was performed using Landsat 8 image to map the forest types in Kapilvastu district of Nepal. Systematic sampling design was adopted to establish sample points in the field, and 70\% samples were used for classification and 30\% samples for accuracy assessment. Landsat image was pre-processed, and the slope and aspect derived from the ASTER DEM were used as additional predictors for classification. Segmentation was done using eCognition v8.0 with the scale parameter of 20, ratios of 0.1 and 0.9 for shape and color, respectively. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and nearest neighbor classifier (k-NN) methods were used for object-based classification. The major forest types observed in the district were KS (Acacia catechu/ Dalbergia sissoo), Sal (Shorea robusta) and Tropical Mixed Hardwood. The k-NN classification technique showed higher overall accuracy than the CART method. The classification approach used in this study can also be applied to classify forest types in other districts. Improvement in classification accuracy can be potentially obtained through inclusion of sufficient samples from all classes.Banko JanakariA Journal of Forestry Information for NepalVol. 26, No. 1, Page: 38-44, 2016},

	abstract = {The high mountains stretch over 20.4\% of Nepal’s land surface with diverse climatic conditions and associated vegetation types. An understanding of tree species and forest structural pattern variations across different climatic regions is crucial for mountain ecology. This study strived to carry out a comparative evaluation of species diversity, main stand variables, and canopy cover of forests with contrasting precipitation conditions in the Annapurna range. Firstly, climate data provided by CHELSA version 1.2, were used to identify distinct precipitation regimes. Lamjung and Mustang were selected as two contrasting precipitation regions, and have average annual precipitation of 2965 mm and 723 mm, respectively. Stratiﬁed random sampling was used to study 16 plots, each measuring 500 m2 and near the tree line at an elevation range of 3000 to 4000 m across different precipitation conditions. In total, 870 trees were identiﬁed and measured. Five hemispherical photos using a ﬁsheye lens were taken in each plot for recording and analyzing canopy cover. Margalef’s index was used to measure species richness, while two diversity indices: the Shannon–Wiener Index and Simpson Index were used for species diversity. Dominant tree species in both study regions were identiﬁed through the Important Value Index (IVI). The Wilcoxon ranksum test was employed to determine the differences in forest structure and composition variables between the two precipitation regimes. In total, 13 species were recorded with broadleaved species predominating in the high precipitation region and coniferous species in the low precipitation region. Higher species richness and species diversity were recorded in the low precipitation region, whereas the main stand variables: basal area and stem density were found to be higher in the high precipitation region. Overall, an inverse J-shaped diameter distribution was found in both precipitation regions signifying uneven-aged forest. A higher proportion of leaning and buttressed trees were recorded in the high precipitation region. However, similar forest canopy cover conditions ({\textgreater}90\%) were observed in both study regions. The ﬁndings of this research provide a comprehensive narrative of tree species and forest structure across distinct precipitation regimes, which can be crucial to administrators and local people for the sustainable management of resources in this complex region.},

	abstract = {Dalbergia latifolia Roxb., commonly known as rosewood, is one of the highly valuable tropical timber species of Nepal. The tree species was widely distributed in the past, however, overexploitation of natural habitat, deforestation, forest conversion for agriculture, illegal logging and the invasion of alien species resulted in the classification of this species as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) category. So, the prediction of habitat suitability and potential distribution of the species is required to develop restoration mechanisms and conservation interventions. In this study, we modelled the suitable habitat of D. latifolia over the entire possible range of Nepal using a Maxent model. We compiled 23 environmental variables (19 bioclimatic, 3 topographic and a vegetative layer), however, only 12 least correlated variables along with 43 spatially representative presence locations were retained for model prediction. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model’s performance and a Jackknife procedure to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables. The model was statistically significant with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.969. The internal Jackknife test indicated that elevation was the most important variable for the model prediction with 71.3\% contribution followed by mean temperature of driest quarter (9.8\%). The most ({\textgreater}0.6) suitable habitat for the D. latifolia was 235 484 hectares with large sections of area in two provinces whereas, the western most provinces were not suitable for D. latifolia as per Maxent model. The information presented here can provide a framework for nature conservation planning, monitoring and habitat management of this rare and endangered species.},
